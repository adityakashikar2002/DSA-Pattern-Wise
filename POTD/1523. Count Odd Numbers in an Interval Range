/**
 * Count how many odd numbers exist between low and high (inclusive).
 *
 * Intuition:
 *  - In any continuous range, roughly half the numbers are odd.
 *  - Base count = (high - low) / 2
 *
 *  But we must check if there is an extra odd due to range boundaries:
 *    Case 1: low is even AND high is even  → no extra odd
 *    Case 2: otherwise (low or high is odd) → +1 odd
 *
 * Example:
 *    low = 3, high = 7
 *    high - low = 7 - 3 = 4
 *    4 / 2 = 2  (base odds)
 *    Since low and high are both odd → add +1
 *    Final answer = 3 odds → [3, 5, 7]
